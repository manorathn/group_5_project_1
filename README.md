## General info
- User Story : As a user, I can search and store the recipes of my choice.

* Motivated by the all too common phrase "what's for dinner", our team sought to offer an easy to use solution to our users. We wanted to be able to, by the use of two powerful API Edamam and Spoonacular, display recipes according to diet and user-input search criteria. Next, the goal was to use local storage to allow users to store their specific recipes in a spot to access later for ultimate convenience. The result of our endeavors was Din-Din!
